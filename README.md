oh my god just left the theater && my brain feels all plankton-soup-dazed. the movie was like being inside a lava lamp, colors n sounds splashing everywhere but somehow it all fits together? or maybe im just still trying to shake those popcorn crumbs out of my teeth. there was this one scene, scenes, all blurring, where plankton had a dance-off with a jellyfish -- not sure if it was underwater or underground??? noisy -> ppl kept whispering, like, have you ever tried to watch a movie with a herd of cattle all munching popcorn? that‚Äôs what it felt like. 

I swear the seats were designed by a chiropractor trying to invent new problems for himself to fix later. my back... feels like it's been twisted by an octopus wrangling its tentacles around my spine. gosh, who knew tiny sea creatures living their miniature lives could hit so hard?? the emotions are like seeing a clown cry at a funeral.

> halfway thru i remembered you asked if you could download the movie ‚Äì totally you should?? but maybe better to watch the movie in the theater if you can stand the noise and crunch. man, the part with the whale orchestra, though, sounded like, what, a kazoo symphony doing karaoke at an underwater rave... epic madness! how can a plankton have such depth? do planktons even have depths? fish philosophy right there.

plankton‚Äôs journey is like if Finding Nemo met Inception while on a sugar high. they'll download plankton's data into your brain n make you dream of tiny critters plotting something grand. i was literally clutching my slushee like a stress ball. i need to process? like, whoa, did my subconscious just become a ziggurat of seaweed puzzles?

don't know how to end this except, maybe accidentally leave you a code snippet that‚Äôs completely useless?? idk. here: 

```python
def confusing_experience(unfathomable):
    if not understand:
        return swim aimlessly
    else:
        return ????
```

there you go, that‚Äôs my brain right now. gonna go lie down or swim or something. üçø
